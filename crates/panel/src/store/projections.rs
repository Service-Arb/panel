//! The projections — `leads`, `calls`, `payments`, the counts of [`super::metrics`], and the
//! bookings of [`super::bookings`] — derived from registered events only.
//!
//! A lead is never patched: every event about it recomputes its row from all of its
//! events ([`panel_core::lead::fold`]), inside the transaction that journaled the event. That
//! transaction holds the database's one write lock ([`super::begin_write`]), so two events of
//! one lead arriving at once cannot each compute without the other. The rebuild calls the
//! very same function, which is why it lands on the same state.
