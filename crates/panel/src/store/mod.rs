//! SQLite: runtime `sqlx` queries, migrations embedded from `migrations/` and applied on open.
//! Every query here is executed by the integration tests (`tests/`), which stand in for the
//! compile-time checks the `query!` macros would give.
//!
//! One file, one writer at a time (WAL: readers never wait for it). Every transaction that
//! writes begins `BEGIN IMMEDIATE` ([`begin_write`]): it takes the write lock up front, so two
//! of them queue on `busy_timeout` instead of both reading under a plain `BEGIN` and the
//! second failing with SQLITE_BUSY when it tries to upgrade to a write. That queue is also
//! what orders ingest against a rebuild, and two events of one lead against each other: what
//! Postgres needed advisory locks for, the single writer gives for nothing. A lone statement
//! outside a transaction is atomic by itself and waits on `busy_timeout` the same way.
