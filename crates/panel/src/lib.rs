//! The panel's engine: a signed batch in, each event checked, journaled and projected.

//! ```text
//! batch ─ signature (source's key) ─┬─ event ─ envelope ─ key may write it? ─ registry ─┐
//!                                   ├─ event …                                          │

//! [`Panel`] is the facade the server talks to; [`wire`] turns protojson into the domain of
//! `panel_core`; [`store`] is SQLite; [`seal`] encrypts what must not sit in the clear.
//! [`operator`] is what a signed-in user does and reads, as events through the same journal;
//! [`session`] is signing in through concierge and the sessions that follow; [`telegram`] the
//! bot's notifications and buttons; [`capture`] what PostHog is told of the leads' lives, sent
//! from an outbox; [`place`] the places' live settings the sites read and the panel edits;
//! [`pricing`] the brands' price lists, the same; [`experiment`] the brands' experiments as
//! configuration; [`booking`] the leads' bookings, the providers' seam and the matching of
//! their bookings to leads; [`live`] the bus that tells the server's sockets what changed,
//! published here after each commit.
