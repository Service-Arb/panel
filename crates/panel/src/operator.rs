//! What an operator does in the panel (spec §5.4, §10a), as events.
//!
//! Every action becomes a `sa.funnel.v1` event of `source.kind = panel`, `source.id` the
//! user's concierge id, and goes through the same decode, registry and journal as a signed
//! batch — only with no signing key (`key_id` NULL). So the projections change the one way
//! they ever change, and a rebuild lands on the same state.
//!
//! And what the operator screens read: leads, a lead's card, the funnel.
